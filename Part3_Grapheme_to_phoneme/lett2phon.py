#### LETTER-to-PHONEME RULES ####
#################################

# These are some very likely letter-to-phoneme mappings.
## TO DO ##
## You can add additional likely letter-to-phoneme correspondences here
## to improve the alignments from which you derive your mapping rules.

baserules = {'F':'F'}

## TO DO ##
## Other ideas:
## set up some rules that allow a letter to map to one of several phones
## set up some conditional rules, e.g., C-> CH before H
## To implement these ideas, you will also need to update the calc_distance function!



# the dict newrules stores the new mappings that your alignment will produce.
# This will be a dictionary mapping a letter to  a list of possible phonemes.
# Keys will be single letters, values will be lists of possible phonemes.
# We will use this set of new mapping rules to
# to guess the pronunciations of words we haven't seen.

### FUNCTIONS ####
##################

# This function compares a letter and phoneme to see how well they match

## TO DO ##
## You can change the way the distance is calculated when performing
## the alignment. 
## Ideas: 
## * assign different values (e.g., 2 instead of 1, .5 for matches
## that are possible but not super likely, etc.).
## * implement something to allow for conditional distances (e.g., 
## C:CH only before H, S:Z at the end of a word after a vowel)
## * add functionality to encourage vowel letters to align to vowel phonemes
