This directory contains:

* lett2phon.py
* trainprons.txt
* testprons.txt
* README

You can run the program with no command line arguments, but
it must be in the same directory as the *prons.txt files.
The code allows for these files to be indicated instead
as command-line arguments. Just swap the # where the 
files are read in.

The pronunciations are adapted from the CMU pronouncing dictionary:

http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict

This website has links to the dictionary itself along with a 
list of the phonemes and examples of what they represent.
It's based on ARPAbet, but as usual, it's not exactly the same.
